# String rules. Will be replaced through a simple string replacement, as the first step of the normalizer. 
# Format: <string to replace>\t<replacement string>
# Lines starting with "#" are regarded as comments.
# Apart from the currency rules, the entire token is expected to be matched  
# (e.g. "mit's" will not be affected by the "it's" rule)
# You can add/remove rules to the list.  
# This file is URF-8 encoded. If you need to work with ascii only, remove non-ascii rules (e.g. currency rules)
