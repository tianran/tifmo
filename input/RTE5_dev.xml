However detectives said they had not found any proof that the 35-year-old, who went missing on 18 March, was dead. Her father Peter Lawrence made a direct appeal to his daughter to contact him five weeks after she disappeared. His plea came at a news conference held shortly after a £10,000 reward was offered to help find Miss Lawrence. Crimestoppers said the sum they were offering was &quot;significantly higher&quot; than usual because of public interest in the case.</t>

		<t>Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year.  Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.</t>

		<t>Even the most draconian proposal — to reinstate flight limits to ease the bottlenecks at Kennedy — might backfire, industry analysts say, because airlines would end up shifting flights to Newark Airport, which is already strained. "Kennedy is the perfect example of putting 10 pounds in a 5-pound bag," said Darryl Jenkins, a longtime airline consultant. "J.F.K. was never set up to be a hub for anybody; its been a gateway," he said. But in recent years it became a hub for JetBlue and Delta. These days, delays at Kennedy are so bad, he said, that "it's backing up the whole country.".</t>

Although he announced from the outset that the fight against corruption would be one of his main priorities, his first year in office has shown that these words—as in the years of presidents Yeltsin and Putin—were nothing more than propaganda. Medvedev occupies the highest post in a state in which corruption is neither a secondary feature nor an aberration, but rather its essence. From top to bottom, corruption in post-Soviet Russia permeates the bureaucratic apparatus, the security structures and big business. Like a virus in the blood of a diseased organism, it is present in all commercial and government relations.

Before these two discoveries, the two previously largest known prime numbers were discovered by UCMO professors Curtis Cooper and Steven Boone in Missouri, United States, and their record lasted almost three years. Historically, prime numbers discovered by GIMPS are larger than the one previously found. The only other exception was when the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and 31st were found.

Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film &quot;Jurassic park&quot; are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins.

Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government's refusal of citizenship to Hicks, whose mother was born in England. Justice Collins said the Government had &quot;no power to withhold or deprive citizenship&quot;. Justice Collins said: &quot;In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country.&quot; Hicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough.

The Miss Megan was pushing barge IBR 234, which was tied along the starboard side of barge Athena 106, en route to a pile-driving location. Athena Construction did not require its crews to pin mooring spuds (vertical steel shafts extending through wells in the bottom of the boat and used for mooring) securely in place on its barges and consequently this had not been done. During the journey, the aft spud on the Athena 106 released from its fully raised position. The spud dropped into the water and struck a submerged, high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The resulting gas released ignited and created a fireball that engulfed the towing vessel and both barges. The master of the towing vessel and four barge workers were killed. The Miss Megan deckhand and one barge worker survived. One barge worker is officially listed as missing.</t>
